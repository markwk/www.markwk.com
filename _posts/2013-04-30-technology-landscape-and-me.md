While some of my friends think I'm some kind of an all-knowing web technology guru, I tend to be much more honest about what I know and know about (which is never enough!) vs. what I don't know and don't even know about.

The image above (which I recommend clicking on to view the full version) from [Chiefmartec.com](http://chiefmartec.com/2012/09/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2012/) makes me a lot more humble about what technologies I truly master.

What an incredible landscape of startup and well-established technologies to build with and amongst today.
