The [latest Carnival of Liberals][1] is up at [Tangled Up in Blue][2]. The [latest Carnival of Political Punditry][3] is also up at [I’m A Pundit Too][4]. My translation and brief introduction [Writing’s Degree of Xeroxing][5] was included in both of these carnivals. My favorite piece had to be [Obama’s Unrealistic Plan for Iraq][6], which critiques Obama’s naïve position on Iraq, namely the fact that Obama continues to defend his pre-war position against the Iraq war and proposes an eventual pull-out AND YET naively Obama cannot maintain his previous, pre-war position and propose a present, post-war, current-war position. His words are beautiful and his pre-war position was probably an accurate one but he cannot help but be aware of the long-term necessity of an American military presence in a politically instable Iraq.  
If you’re someone who blogs about liberalism and politics and wants to participate in a blog carnival, check out the submission forms and guidelines for the [Carnival of the Liberals][7] and [Carnival of Political Punditry][8]. Keep reading! And, of course, keep blogging!
