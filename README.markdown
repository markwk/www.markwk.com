## Markwk.com README

Find this site at www.markwk.com! 

#### Tech Specs

This site is power by  [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) with a few customizations for styling, usability and discoverability. 

You can read about the latest migration and transition in my blog at [Migrating to Jekyll, Again: How to Migrate Your Octopress Blog to Standard Jekyll](http://www.markwk.com/2021/02/jekyll-remigration.html) (circa early 2021). 

This site previously was migrated from WordPress and used [Octopress](http://octopress.org). You can read it on my blog in [Migrating from WordPress to Octopress / Jekyll](http://www.markwk.com/2013/04/wordpress-migrations-to-octopress-blog.html) (circa 2013!).
