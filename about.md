__UPDATED: March 14, 2021__

Hi! My name is Mark Koester. I'm a phenomenologist and technologist. I ponder life's fundamental questions through an on-going exploration of human experience and behavior, and I design and build "enablers" or tools (mostly digital [products](http://www.markwk.com/products/), books and, of course, this [blog](http://www.markwk.com/)) that attempt to maximize human potential, health and creativity. 

I also love speaking, teaching courses, running innovation events and programs, and building product-centric companies. 

### About This Blog

I’ve been writing this blog in some form since 2007. I use my blog and writings in general to think through, document and share various ideas. On multiple occasions, I have sought to try to establish a “theme” for the writings here, but with little success. Each attempt to force some sort of one-dimensionality tends to, like a medusa, grow new heads. Thus, this space will remain an organic space for my writings, learnings and creativity (warts and all!).

Individual themes can be explored across multiple pieces using the category tags. 

For example, if you want to dive into self-tracking and data-driven life, checkout [“Tracking Everything”](http://www.markwk.com/category/track-everything/), which covers a range of topics related to self-tracking, health, and the quantified self including all of my quantified self, self-tracking and biohacker experiments. 

If you are interested in behavior change and goals, you can go through various posts under the rubric of ["The Science of Goals"](http://www.markwk.com/category/science-of-goals/) where I explore psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience as it relates to changing human action and decision making. 

Broadly speaking, my writings have included at one time or other: [travel](http://www.markwk.com/category/travel/), [startups](http://www.markwk.com/category/startups/), running a tech business, digital nomad life, [language](http://www.markwk.com/category/language/), [running](http://www.markwk.com/category/running/), web design, [cross-cultural experience and understanding](http://www.markwk.com/category/abroad/), storytelling, religion and atheism, sociology and, of course, a good bit of [philosophy](http://www.markwk.com/category/philosophy/) mixed in.

If you enjoyed something you read, I’d love to hear from you or read something you’ve written. Please send me your comments and questions to markwkoester at gmail.com or reach out to me through one of [my social media accounts](http://www.markwk.com/contact).
