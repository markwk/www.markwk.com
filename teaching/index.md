I have been teaching off and on for the last several years. I'm extremely passionate about learning and teaching. I think education is one of the most important and positive things we can do for the world around us--both individually and collectively. 

Eventhough I'm currently not employed as a teacher, I still consider myself a teacher in sense of helping the people around me learn and grow. I hope to continue as a formal teacher someday soon in the future. 

## Teaching in China

While in China, I had the opportunity to teach several great groups of students on a variety of subjects. In terms of English teaching, I taught both oral English as well as English writing. On the technical side, I had the opportunitity to teach a few classes on Open Source Web Design (in particular Drupal). I also taught a seminar on European History and Culture. 

## Language-Corner.org: Group-learning Spaces

One of my biggest projects as a teacher was [Language-Corner.org](http://language-corner.org). This group-learning site was built over several years to help make learning more enaging for foreign language learners and to improve the ability of teachers interact with large groups in a today's social media age. While the site is no longer under active development or usage, I'm extremely proud of the work acheived through this effort. 

I think there is definitely a place in my heart for building a grass-roots educational platform for language studies--both as a way to make learning better for students but as as a way for teachers to interact more effectively. 

Throughout the process of building Language Corner, I've contributed back various pieces of code, including [Quizlet for Drupal](http://drupal.org/projects/drupal) and [various features for OpenAtrium](http://int3c.com/experts/openatrium-customizations). 

Along with building code and designing the site experience, I also blogged about the process and evolution. Here are some of my best posts:

* [Creating a Collaborative Learning Environment](http://language-corner.org/blog/2011/10/aim-core-needs-mashup-external-services-creating-collaborative-learning-environment)
* [Open Source Education: Thoughts](http://www.markwk.com/2011/03/open-source-education-thoughts.html): a general overview of the evolution of teaching technologies leading to Drupal 
* [Working Together: Wiki, ESL Writing Project](http://www.markwk.com/2010/11/working-together-wiki-esl-writing-project-update.html): a description of using MediaWiki to do collborative student writing

## Past Lessons:

There are a number of lessons I have developed and adapted over the past several years. A few in particular I find are quite effective teach tools. Here are some of my favorites:

* [Quino Cartoon, Picasso's Guernica, Guernica Historical Photos](http://www.markwk.com/teaching/lessons/quino-picasso-%20guernica/quino-esl-lesson.html)
* [Language about the Future: A Future Filled With Robots? (PPT Download Pdf)](http://www.markwk.com/teaching/lessons/future/future.pdf)
