There is a poem that reminds me of a friend I haven’t seen in ages, literally ages of myself and, I can only imagine, ages for her as well. 
 

Hope is the Thing with Feathers, by Emily Dickinson

> “Hope” is the thing with feathers  
> That perches in the soul  
> And sings the tune without the words  
> And never stops at all,
> 
> And sweetest in the gale is heard;  
> And sore must be the storm  
> That could abash the little bird  
> That kept so many warm.
> 
> I’ve heard it in the chillest land  
> And on the strangest sea,  
> Yet never, in extremity,  
> It asked a crumb of me.



  


The above painting that is entitled “Loiseau de l’espoir” by Sylvie Lemelin is available on [her website][2].
