I landed in Kuala Lumpur (KL) from Chengdu, China, where I’d been “resting" for the past month or so. I’d gotten quite a few things accomplished over the last couple weeks, so it was time to get back on the road to work and explore. 

(NOTE: This is my first official post of a new series [“The Traveling Entrepreneur,”](http://www.markwk.com/category/traveling-entrepreneur/) which I plan to try and maintain as I travel and work around the world.)

I’d been to a number of a places in Southeast Asia over the last several months like Vietnam, [Burma](http://www.markwk.com/2014/02/how-i-learned-travel-burmese.html), and Thailand, so when the ticket prices dropped by $100 or so, I didn’t hesitate much: my first visit to Malaysia. 


In the end, I spent about 4 or 5 days in Kuala Lumpur. It’s probably a city that could be toured in 2-3 days or even a working-travel base for several weeks. I wasn’t quite ready to set, so I mostly visited the sites, enjoyed the food, and explored the night life before adventuring further south. 

__Where to Stay?_ In Kuala Lumpur, I stayed in Chinatown, which is centrally located. It seems like Sentral is also a good location for exploring the city. In my opinion, both these places (Chinatown and Sentral) are good places for a tourist or brief visit. Both allow easy access to various public transportation to and from the airport as well as various transport around town or two site outside city. I wouldn’t recommend these area, if I was to stay longer on a future visit. 

__Tourist spots?__ I wouldn’t rank Kuala Lumpur high on the best-of-travel list, but it had a number of nice spots. is In terms of tourist highlights, here were my favorites:

* Chinatown
* Batu Caves
* Twin Towers
* Malls
* Eating

Central KL is easily explored on foot, though during the afternoons it can be pretty hot, so make sure to head into a nearby mall to cool off with some shopping, snacks, etc. I didn’t get a chance to head to any of the mall, but I’d love to check out one of them on history or Islam next time I’m in town. 

__Where to Go Out?__ I didn’t go out much while in KL, but it seems like the main area is a couple blocks from the Twin Towers where you find a series of clubs and bars on one main street. Just tell your taxi driver to take you to “Beach Club” and you can easily find a place to fit your mood for the evening. 

__Tips for the Traveling Worker:__ Like Thailand, the internet speeds were decent in KL. Some places were better than others, but overall the speed was good enough for most of my needs. Just be careful when booking your hotel that you choose a place that the various reviewers didn’t denigrate with poor internet or wifi. 

That’s about it folks. KL is a nice city. While I wouldn’t recommend it to the first time visitor to Asia or Southeast Asia, it’s definitely a nice spot for getting away, eating some good stuff and exploring a new mix of people and cultures.
