Every year I scribble away my New Year's resolutions. I'm sure they are stored somewhere (likely Evernote!), and it makes me happy to know that I at least make the effort once a year or so to evaluate where I'm going. I can look back at some point in my life and see how quaint my ideas on resolving things. 

Unfortunately time passes and I lose focus on where I was driving. To be frank, it sometimes feel like I've been asleep at the wheel and a couple months have already passed by without even checking the map. I try blogging occassionally about my goal and use various apps to get me on track. But all the same, I'd really like to improve my ability to set correct goals and acheive them. 

Perhaps it's time to step back and work on the "goal setting and iteration of those goals" process. Time to *establish a proper goal setting cycle*.

## To the Starting Line: Establishing Limited Number of Goals

I actually think I'm pretty good at acheiving my goals. Over the past few years, I've managed to learn French and Chinese as well significantly develop my web development skills. Several years before, when I was in college, I even managed to graduate early and without debt. So, even though I don't really work full-time, I don't really consider myself a slacker. I just evaluate time so I have do both: live and work. 

At the same time though, I think I can improve how I approach my goals. It's not my goals that are failing me; it's me failing in *establishing a proper goal setting cycle*. 

According to my Evernote record, apparantly I established 6 goals for 2013: 

{% blockquote %}
1. Learn Spanish
2. Write a Book
3. Get Healthier with more exercise
4. Events Sites Launch
5. Learn more javascript
{% endblockquote %}

While all of these are good goals, it's pretty hard to work on all of them at the same time without failing most of them. So let's cut it down to just two goals: one professional goal and one personal goal. 

At this stage in my life, it's tough to focus on just two when all of them seem like good goals for me. Unfortunately, I think if we want to get things done we got keep this list limited. 

Why? Well, I think goals need to be big and long-term. They should be hard and require various steps to get there. 

I suppose some of my previously mentioned "goals" fall more into the realm of better habits, so let's remove number 3 about more exercise since I'm making this a lifestyle change and let's eliminate number 5 for now too, since need to balance study and career-driven goals. Let's also leave off "Write a Book" for this current goal setting cycle. 

That leaves us with two goals:

* Personal: *Learn Spanish*
* Professional: *Event Site Launch*

## Announce the Game: Publicize Your Goals, Talk About Them 

It's not necessarily correct to talk openly about every kind of goal you are working on. But for many it's a good step to improving your chance at acheiving it. I personally like to write and talk with people about what I'm working on. 

Since I'm trying to become more active as a blogger and writer, I think [this space is a good one to post my goals](www.markwk.com/goals). I've also created a custom sidebar listing my current goals. 

I don't really have any data to back up this claim, but I think that publicizing your goals makes it harder to let them drop. I also think [evaluating the learning process](www.markwk.com/category/learning/) is a good way to improve how you learn a subject. 

I guess my main point is simple: *Don't hide the fact that you are working on something, since your chance of success rises with more people*.

## Put Up the Goal Posts: Establish Habits, Monthly Goals, Weekly Evaluations

The point of most goals is to establish a habit and then through doing that habit over and over, you eventually acheive mastery. Some goals aren't really as simple as etablishing a single habit (like practice the guitar everyday), since they are slightly more complicated (not that learning the guitar isn't complicated!). Some goals require multiple steps and series of sub-goals before you can properly say you have acheived them. 

So, in line with this, *establish some montly goals in view of that end goal*. Then work each week towards that monthly goal. 

Moreover, try and establish weekly goals and break them down into daily steps towards them. It's also consider a good practices (which I'm still working on these past couple weeks) to do weekly evaluations. The idea being that by evaluating yourself and your work each week you can comfortably say what you have done well? what you failed at? and how you can work more productively toward achieving your goal?

I'm not expert here, just a fellow traveller. Hopefully, in the end, through your own kind of "goal setting cycles," you'll acheive your goals.

Even if you never quite get there, don't forget that the most important step is always be moving the ball foward, because eventually you'll cross the goal line and not even realize it.
