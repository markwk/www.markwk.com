**This Blog is Now Powered by Octopress, a Member of the Jekyll family.**

I've been itching to get my personal blog off of WordPress for sometime. Since I mostly work with Drupal, I had considered migrating it to Drupal, which resulted in one of my most popular posts in a long time on [Drupal vs WordPress](http://int3c.com/blog/2012/11/why-migrate-wordpress-drupal-drupal-vs-wordpress). 

Even though I pay my bills building with Drupal, I didn't want another site on Drupal. While Drupal provides a great setup for many types of sites, for my blog it's a bit of an overkill in some ways with the backend database. There has been a big WordPress security issue recently. But in the end, I want to get away from WordPress is that it isn't geeky enough for me. 

So, I decided to get to the heart of blogging geekiness with a Jekyll-powered blog using Octopress. 

Here's the what's, why's, and how's in moving my WordPress blog onto a Jekyll/Octopress setup.
