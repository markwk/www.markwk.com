I've been thinking quite a bit these days. Evaluating instead of just being the tag-along reflection. Eh! Maybe it was: the strangeness of having so many people around, then some solitude, then some retreat. Then writing. It's in writing it out (in) that we find it out. Or so I believe. The twitter sphere to a point in a blogged space. To something other than my-Self.
