From *The Grammarian and the Dervish*, p. 193, from *Tales of the Dervishes* by Idries Shah (Octagon Press, 1967):  
> *One dark night a dervish was passing a dry well when he heard a cry for help from below. "What is the matter?" he called down.* 
> *"I am a grammarian, and I have unfortunately fallen, due to my ignorance of the path, into this deep well, in which I am now all but immobilized," responded the other.*
> 
> *"Hold, friend, and I'll fetch a ladder and rope," said the dervish.*
> 
> *"One moment, please!" said the grammarian. "Your grammar and diction are faulty; be good enough to amend them."*
> 
> *"If that is so much more important than the essentials," shouted the dervish, "***you*** had best stay where you are until ***I*** have learned to speak properly."*
> 
> *And he went on his way.*
