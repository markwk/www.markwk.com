I just was informed by my university (成都理工大学) about the date and time for my next speech or lecture. The title of the speech is Are you ready? Tips for Working, Living and Studying Abroad (or in Chinese: 了解工作学习和生活在国外). The speech will take place at Chengdu University of Technology in Building 6B Room 405 at 7 pm on June 10th.

I look forward to talking to a wider audience of university students about life abroad and about future possibilities. I’ll hopefully be able to post parts of my speech online as well as photos from the event.

Here’s a copy of the advertisement I created for the event:
