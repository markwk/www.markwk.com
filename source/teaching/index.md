I have been teaching off and on for the last several years. I'm extremely passionate about learning and teaching. I think education is one of the most important and positive things we can do for the world around us--both individually and collectively. 

## Teaching in China

While in China, I had the opportunity to teach several great groups of students on a variety of subjects. In terms of English teaching, I taught both oral English as well as English writing. On the technical side, I had the opportunitity to teach a few classes on Open Source Web Design (in particular Drupal). I also taught a seminar on European History and Culture. 

## Language-Corner.org: Group-learning Spaces

{% img left /images/language-corner-logo.png %}

One of my biggest projects as a teacher was [Language-Corner.org](http://language-corner.org). This group-learning site was built over several years to help make learning more enaging for foreign language learners and to improve the ability of teachers interact with large groups in a today's social media age. While the site is no longer under active development or usage, I'm extremely proud of the work acheived through this effort. 

Here's a post summarizing some of the previous work and evolution of Language-Corner.org.

## Future in Teaching?

While I am not at present teaching, I still consider myself a teacher. I hope to continue teaching someday soon in the future. 

## Past Lessons:

There are a number of lessons I have developed and adapted over the past several years. A few in particular I find are quite effective teach tools. Here are some of my favorites:

* Quino...
* Violence...
