Hi, I’m Mark!

I haven't figured out if I'm a social scientist with a passion for technology or a technologist with a passion for the social sciences. Either way, welcome to my “webbed” space.

I’ve been writing this blog in some form since 2007. I use my blog and writings in general to think through, document and share various ideas. On multiple occasions, I have sought to try to establish a “theme” for the writings here, but with little success. Each attempt to force some sort of one-dimensionality tends to, like a medusa, grow new heads. Thus, this space will remain an organic space for my writings, learnings and creativity (warts and all!). 

Individual themes can be explored across multiple pieces using the category tags. For example, if you want to dive into self-tracking and data-driven life, checkout ["Tracking Everything"](http://www.markwk.com/category/track-everything/), which covers a range of topics related to self-tracking, health, and the quantified self including all of my tracking experiments. 

Broadly speaking my writings have included at one time or other: [travel](http://www.markwk.com/category/travel/), [startups](http://www.markwk.com/category/startups/), running a tech business, digital nomad life, [language](http://www.markwk.com/category/language/), [running](http://www.markwk.com/category/running/), web design, [cross-cultural experience and understanding](http://www.markwk.com/category/abroad/), storytelling, religion and atheism, sociology and, of course, a good bit of philosophy mixed in. 

As certain projects evolve and mature, I tend to create separate products, sites and tools accordingly. You can see a few of them in ["products page"](http://www.markwk.com/products), including [Data-Driven You](http://www.datadrivenyou.com), the primary home on using personal data for self-understanding and self-improvement. 

On the professional side, I'm also a software developer and tech entrepreneur, and I work on web, mobile and data applications. You can find my open source developer work at [github.com/markwk/](https://github.com/markwk/). My company Int3c and our portfolio of public projects and clients can be found at [Int3c.com](http://int3c.com/). 

If you enjoyed something you read, I'd love to hear from you or read something you've written. Please send me your comments and questions to markwkoester at gmail.com or reach out to me through one of [my social media accounts](http://www.markwk.com/contact).

### Where am I from? Where am I now? 

**Currently Somewhere in Asia**

I was born grew up in the Omaha, Nebraska, United States. I went to university in Chicago and later in Paris and Strasbourg, France. I have lived abroad in France, China, Singapore, and a few other countries since 2005. I own a house in Western China. Checkout that story in [Living in Qingchengshan](http://www.markwk.com/living-in-qingchengshan.html).

I am fluent in English, French, Chinese, and Spanish, proficient in multiple coding languages, and can manage a blathering of other tongues. 

I'm current based part of the year in California and part in Asia. 

### Running with My Husky

As a side note, I've also assembled a bit of a house of dogs and cats over the years, all rescue strays. Here is a recent photo of me and my Husky enjoying a fun run in the mountains!
