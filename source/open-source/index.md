# 

I am strong believer in the free and open source software movement. I am mostly focused on Drupal right now and regularly contribute modules and code at [github.com/markwk](https://github.com/markwk/) as [markwk on drupal.org](drupal.org/user/1094790/). 

Besides PHP and front end work with HTML/CSS, I'm also keen on learning new and emerging technologies and like to play around with Ruby, Python and am a blossoming Javascript-er. 

Here is a previous article on ["Open Source Education: Thoughts"](http://www.markwk.com/2011/03/open-source-education-thoughts.html), which, while the technology choices are particularly out-of-date, describes well my process in creating Language-Corner.org. 

Hopefully someday I'll have more to write about my open source life and the good it is doing to our world.
