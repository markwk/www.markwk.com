### About How I Read

I currently track my book reading with Goodreads. Here's [how I track my book reading](http://www.markwk.com/2016/11/book-reading-tracking.html).

I read around 50-60 books a year, which I typically share a post on in my year in reading along with my other [year in data review](http://www.markwk.com/category/year-in-data/). 

My aim is to [read 2000 books](http://www.markwk.com/2016/06/2000-book-reading-challenge.html) in coming decade or so. I'm currently at around 1050 books. So about halfway there and my great books to come!

 I read a wide range of book types. You can find my current readings [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16033659-mark-koester). 

[Contact me](http://www.markwk.com/contact/) if you have a great book to recommend!
